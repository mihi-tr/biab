# Budget in a Box

Budget in a Box is a Django webapp for generating nice budget and spending visualization
sites automatically from Budget Data Packages. Simply point BiaB at the URL of a valid BDP dataset
and BiaB will create a site with rich visualization views of the data. New BDPs can be added to
the site at any time.

*This is a prototype release with basic functionality, to be presented at OKFest 2014.
As of the writing of this README, literally no functionality has been implemented.*
